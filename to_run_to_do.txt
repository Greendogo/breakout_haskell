To-Do-List:
    -Make hitting the ball with different parts of the paddle make it go in different directions - research breakout games and trig functions
    -Smooth out movement of paddle, it's too granular and stuttery; maybe look at the keypress example - done
    -Research if breakout games usually give players up and down motion - done -nope
    -Make the blocks have different colors; maybe figure out a random function to use with colors for everything
    -Make a background
    -Winning and losing conditions
        -Make hitting the bottom take a life - give the player 3 to start with; when they run out of lives, give a game over message; keep track of their score and when they lose post their new high score or their old highscore (give like their ten best or something).
        -Make destroying all the blocks give the player a message; keep track of their score. After clicking somewhere or waiting so long make the a new game start.
